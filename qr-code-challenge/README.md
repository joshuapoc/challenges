### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My main goals with this project is to grasp a better understanding of flexbox, positioning, image manipulation, css functions like
media queries and import

-in order to center the qr container with flex, setting the body height to min-height: 100vh of the viewport so flex could  vertically center its content is required. It needs to be min-height, so there isnt any cropping or overflowing on smaller screens


### Continued development
This are the topics i feel i need to keep working on the most 

- units
- flexbox
